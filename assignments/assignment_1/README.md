# Assignment 1: Environment Setup and Introduction to Python

Run the program `assignment_1.py` from **within your virtual machine**. Do neither run it in a local Python installation nor in a notebook on Azure!

  1. Describe what files this program generates and attach the contents of each file together with its name to your solution.
  2. What is the output of this program.
  3. Describe in natural language and line-by-line what the program. Describe also for each line what the Python code expresses.


## Hints:

  * To run the program sucessfully you need to be connected to the internet.
  * You can run the program either from the command-line `$ python assignment_1.py` or from within a notebook by importing `assignment_1.py` via:
  ```
  import assignment_1


  assignment_1.run()
  ```

  To do the latter the file `assignment_1.py` has to be located in the same directory as the notebook you are working on.
